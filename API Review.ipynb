    "Representational State Transfer - follows a protocol, architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development\n",
    "HTTP\n",
    "GET - retrieve resource\n",
    "PUT - to change state of or update a resource eg. oject, file, block\n",
    "POST - create that resource\n",
    "DELETE - remove that resource\n",

    "5. REST is a logical choice for building APIs that allows users to connect and interact with cloud services \n",
